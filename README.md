# Programming-Languages-Final-Project
Converts Pascal Code to C++
In the class project, we are going to write an interpreter for a subset of the TIPS programming language.
TIPS itself stands for Ten Instruction Pascal Subset

Our first programming assignment for the project is to write a lexical analyzer for a subset of the language
TIPS, which itself is a subset of the Pascal programming language. TIPS stands for Ten Instruction
Pascal Subset; see the attached book (which dates from the Pleistocene epoch of computing).
The job of a lexical analyzer is to return the lexemes (i.e., fundamental syntactical elements) in the input
program to a parser for further analysis. You will use C++ and flex for this assignment.

Create a recursive descent parser for a subset of Ten Instruction Pascal Subset (TIPS). Use your corrected
rules.l from Part 1 for the lexical analyzer portion of your parser.

The next step in creating an interpreter for TIPS is to create a parse tree of the input while checking the syntax
of the input.

The final step in the sequence of projects is to create a TIPS interpreter
